##Title##
Do you know ~~what~~ *who* you’re drinking?

##Abstract##
There’s so many brands of beer out there to choose from. Some of them are global and very well known, like Heineken, Guinness, Carlsberg, or even Asahi, and others are quite a lot smaller, local brands, and even independent breweries. But do we always know what we’re drinking, or even who we’re drinking?
In the era of megacorporations, shareholders, and extremely diversified portfolios and assets, the lines connecting the “owners” to their “products” turn into a Gordian knot, impossible to untangle completely. This is especially the case for Beer groups. Some of the biggest and most well-known brands own breweries and other smaller brands all over the world. A shocking example is the Japanese-founded-and-owned Asahi group, which owns the Italian Peroni brand, considered a staple beer in Italy. It’s examples like these that led us to our main research questions: 
* Do we always know who (whose beer) we’re drinking? 
* Does an acquisition of a beer/brewery affect the quality of the product?
* Are beer experts a self-fulfilling prophecy? I.e. does their expertise and knowledge of beers, companies, and news introduce bias in their reviews of large beer groups?

##Research Questions##
Does the size of a company influence the consumers' opinions? 
Does a merger between two companies, or an acquisition of one from another, change the quality of the brewed beers?
Does the reviewer consider the scale of the brewery when evaluating their beers?
