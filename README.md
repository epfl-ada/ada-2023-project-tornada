## Title

~~What~~*Who* are you drinking?

## Abstract
In this study we aim to examine the effect to a brewery's output that is caused by ownership by a large corporation. More precisely, we aim to determine if being a 'big' beer translates to obtaining lower ratings on BeerAdvocate. In doing so, we will get a better grasp of the beer industry and a better look at its key players. 


## Research Question
* Does the size of a company influence the consumers' opinions? 

## Additional Datasets
We create a dataset for each of the 5 biggest brands of the original dataset (ABinBev, Heineken, Carlsberg, Asahi, Diaego) which track all the breweries they own for each year of interest, i.e 2010-2016. These datasets are created from their annual reports available on the internet. 

In addition, we only use the dataset from BeerAdvocate. We found that matching was not always done correctly in the matched beer dataset, and decided to keep the larger dataset in order to be sure that our data would be reliable.

The additional datasets are in the 'data' folder.

## Methods

We first visualize the data in different ways in order to get a feel of the dataset. Then, we perform matching on different covariates, and finish with a T-Test.

## Conclusions

Being small causes a beer to receive better ratings on BeerAdvocate.

## Jupyter Notebook

All of the above analysis, and more, is done on the notebook P3.ipynb.
